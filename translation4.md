B. Grammatical Questions
What case is decem annōs and why? Accusative because it is a phrase expressing the duration of time in which an event took place.

Parse possent (PNTMV) and explain its mood. 3rd person, plural, active, imperfect, subjunctive. Subjunctive because it is a hypothetical idea. **Why in this specific clause introduced by *cum* does Hyginus choose subjunctive rather than indicative?**

Explain the sentence structure of DANAI MINERVAE DONUM DANT? Although reading it now we understand that the action was in the past, at the time, the action was present which is why dant is in the present tense. **Can you identify the function (e.g., subject, verb, direct object...) of each word?**

What type of verb is arbitrati sunt? Transitive **Yes. What term can we use to describe verbs with  passive form but active meaning?**

What kind of grammatical construction do we have in the sentence Priamus imperavit equum in templum Minervae duci? Identify its constituent parts. Indirect and direct statement. Direct: "Priamus imperavit" Indirect: "equum in templum Minervae duci"

Parse duci. Perfect, passive, infinitive

What case is ei and what role is it playing in the sentence? Nominative and plural, it is talking about the faith belonging to the Trojans.  **How can it be nominative if *data est* is the verb?**

What is the function of the que in portārumque? It adds the idea of "both" to the word it is combined with. **Yes - it's a conjunction**

Translation

When the Greeks were not able to capture Troy for ten years, Epeus made a horse of wood of amazing size.
In it were collected Menelaus, Ulixes, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus.
and on it they wrote "The Greeks give a gift to Minerva", they transferred their military camps to Tenedos.
When the Trojans had seen it, they thought they had judged the enemy;  **The phrase *arbitrati sunt* means "They thought or judged".  What is the verb of the indirect statement?**
Priamus ordered the horse to be led into the temple of Minerva.
When the prophet, Cassandra, would say that the enemy has the horse,  **Figure out what kind of clause this is in Latin.  We would not use "would" in English to express this idea.**
she did not give them faith **What is the subject and verb?**
and the horse was placed in front of the temple. **Identify the form of *posuērunt*.**
The Greeks got out and killed both guards at the gates **Where did you find the idea of "both"?**
and Troy was conquered. **What case is *Troiam*?**
