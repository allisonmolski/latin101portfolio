When the Greeks were not able to capture Troy for ten years, Epeus made a horse of wood of amazing size.
In it was collected Menelaus, Ulixes, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus.
and on it they wrote "The Greeks give a gift to Minerva", they transferred their military camps to Tenedos.
When the Trojans had seen it, they thought they had judged the enemy; Priamus ordered the horse to be led into the temple of Minerva.
When the prophet, Cassandra, would say that the enemy has the horse, she did not give them faith and the horse was placed in front of the temple.
The Greeks got out and killed both guards at the gates and Troy was conquered.
