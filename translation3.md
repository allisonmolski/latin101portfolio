C. Translation
Please translate the passage into idiomatic English.

Erechtheus, the son of Pandion, had four sisters. (**Vocabulary check:  *filia* is not "sister"...**)
At the time, Eumolpus, the son of Neptune, came in order to attack Athens, but he was killed.
Angry because his son was killed, Neptune said "Erecthei was sacrificed" (**What is the subject of Neptune's statement? What does *immolanda* agree with?**)
And so, Chthonia, the first sister, was sacrificed. (**First = *primus, -a, -um*;   *unus* == "one"**)
The other sisters sacrificed themselves; Erechtheus himself was struck by a lightning bolt.
