Erechtheus, the son of Pandion, had four sisters. 
At the time, Eumolpus, the son of Neptune, came in order to attack Athens, but he was killed. 
Angry because his son was killed, Neptune said "Erecthei was sacrificed"
And so, Chthonia, the first sister, was sacrificed. 
The other sisters sacrificed themselves; Erechtheus himself was struck by a lightning bolt.
