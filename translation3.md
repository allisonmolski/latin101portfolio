C. Translation
Please translate the passage into idiomatic English.

Erechtheus, the son of Pandion, had four daughters.
At the time, Eumolpus, the son of Neptune, came in order to attack Athens, but he was killed.
Angry because his son was killed, Neptune said "The daughter of Erecthei must be sacrificed".
And so, Chthonia, one of the daughters, was sacrificed.
The other sisters sacrificed themselves; Erechtheus himself was struck by a lightning bolt.
