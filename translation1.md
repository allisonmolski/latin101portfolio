C. Translation
Please translate the passage into idiomatic English.

Chaos was first of the gods.
Of his daughters, Nox was goddess of the earth and mother of all humans. **We need to figure out the subject of this sentence and, since you've identified the verb correctly as a form of "to be", a predicate.  That will help you get the translation right.**
This **(or just "she")** was the mother of the god of death and destruction.
The sons of that mother were horrible monsters: Typhon, Python, and Cyclopes.
Typhon and Python were huge dragons and Cyclopes of a foolish stone worker.  **(Cyclopes is actually a PLURAL from the name *Cyclops, Cyclopis* "Cyclops". That will help you make sense of this sentence.)**
But the brother of them was Uranus, himself the first king of the gods.
He was strong and great, but wise.
